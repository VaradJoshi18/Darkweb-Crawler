# Dark Web Crawler

Dark Web Crawler is a Python-based application designed to crawl and clone websites on the dark web (specifically, `.onion` domains) using the Tor network. The tool downloads web pages along with their essential assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS), storing them locally for offline browsing and analysis.

## Features

- **Dark Web Crawling:** Specifically built to target dark web (`.onion`) websites using Tor.
- **Asset Downloading:** Downloads essential assets (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images) to create a local clone of the website.
- **Recursive Crawling:** Follows internal links on the site up to a specified depth (default depth level is 3).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A simple Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input a URL and start the crawling process.
- **Local Storage:** Saves the cloned website in a structured folder named `darkweb_clone`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you are running Python version 3.6 or higher.
- **Tor**: The script uses a Tor proxy. Make sure the Tor service is installed and running on your machine, listening on port `9050`.
- **Python Packages:**
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `tkinter` (typically included with the standard Python distribution)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darkweb-crawler.git
   cd darkweb-crawler
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

4. **Install and Run Tor:**

   - **Linux:** Install the Tor package via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install tor`), then start the Tor service.
   - **Windows/Mac:** Download the Tor Browser from the [official website](https://www.torproject.org/) and run it, ensuring the proxy is accessible on port 9050.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application:**

   Execute the Python script:

   ```bash
   python darkweb_crawler.py
   ```

2. **Interface Overview:**

   - A GUI window will appear prompting you to enter a `.onion` URL.
   - Enter the target dark web URL and click on **Start Crawling**.

3. **Crawling Process:**

   - The application will begin crawling from the provided URL.
   - It will recursively navigate through links found on the site (up to a specified depth) and download HTML pages along with assets (images, scripts, and CSS).
   - Downloaded files are saved in a folder named `darkweb_clone` within the project directory.

4. **Viewing the Cloned Site:**

   - Navigate to the `darkweb_clone` folder to view the saved websites.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the cloned homepage.

## How It Works

- **Tor Proxy Configuration:**  
  The tool is configured to use the Tor network via a SOCKS5 proxy running on `127.0.0.1:9050` (both for HTTP and HTTPS requests).

- **Asset Handling:**  
  The script uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and find tags such as `<img>`, `<link>`, and `<script>`. Each asset is downloaded, and its reference within the HTML is updated to point to the local file.

- **Recursive Crawling:**  
  URLs are collected from `<a>` tags and recursively processed to a user-defined depth. The crawler ensures that each URL is only processed once to avoid infinite loops.

- **GUI Interface:**  
  Tkinter is used to create a simple window interface where users can input a `.onion` URL and start the crawling in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
